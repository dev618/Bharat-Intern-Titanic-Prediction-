The system predicts survival during a sinking event based on factors like socio-economic status, age, gender, etc. Machine learning algorithms process historical data, and features are engineered for training. Models like Random Forest or Logistic Regression learn patterns and provide probabilities. Being female, young, and higher socio-economic class may increase survival chances. Caution: The system is supplementary and should not replace safety protocols or expert assistance. Accuracy relies on data quality and regular updates.
